    # Boolean that indicates all objects (including any
    # locked objects) should be deleted from the backup bucket when the bucket
    # is destroyed so that the bucket can be destroyed without error.
    # These objects are not recoverable. This only deletes objects
    # when the bucket is destroyed, not when setting this parameter
    # to true. If setting this field in the same operation that would
    # require replacing the bucket or destroying the bucket, this
    # flag will not work.
